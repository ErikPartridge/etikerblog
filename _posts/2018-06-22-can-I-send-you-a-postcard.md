## Looking back
Most of us have received promotional mail at some point in our lives. Most of the time we might have called it junk mail. Before email, direct mail was one of the preferred tactics of marketers. Today, the tactic has been eclipsed by email marketing, but is by no means gone. In fact, millenials are [more likely](https://www.digitaldogdirect.com/millennials-direct-mail/) than previous generations to read direct mail, and substantially more likely to respond to direct mail than email.

## Combining digital and offline
Marketing using postcards can be quite effective. Response rates hover around 4% per postcard, not bad, considering the low cost of production (varies from $1.00 to $0.50 depending on scale). On average, using direct marketing means $20 spent per customer acquisition. For most businesses, this sounds great, but this is not inherently ethical. 

The big challenge here is acquiring the mailing lists. Most online signup forms do not ask for addresses, and those that do generally do not requst user consent to mail them promotional items. Sending promotional materials requires a basic level of informed consent, and there's a few ways to do this. Asking at signup for consent to send direct mail when you ask for the address, is a great way. Another great way is sending out an email asking for permission to send a coupon via mail. This one is great&emdash;this gives informed consent, this encourages the user to read your emails, and leaves them thinking about your company for a few days before they receive your letter.

When the digital and offline are properly combined, you can achieve excellent and ethical marketing. In fact, compared to many digital forms of marketing, direct mail is relatively simple to check your ethical boxes. We at Etiker love direct mail&emdash;and we'd love to send you a postcard! Drop us an [email](mailto:hello@etiker.com), or read on to find out how to get a kind card from us.

## The environmental dilemma
Another factor to take into consideration with direct mailing is the environmental impact. Compared to emails, the environmental impact of direct mailing is huge&emdash;there is the transportation pollution, accompanied with the paper used in the creation of the postcard. Production will run approximately 6 grams of carbon, and the transportation will run about 20 grams of carbon, both per postcard [InspiredEconomist](http://inspiredeconomist.com/2009/03/09/greening-print-marketing-whats-your-mails-carbon-footprint/). The easiest way to address this is by buying carbon offsets, however, the effectiveness of this is still up for some debate [Hyams, Fawcett](https://doi.org/10.1002/wcc.207). If you are considering going down that route, take ten minutes and do a bit of reading! It'll pay off.

The other key aspect is ensuring your materials are recyclable. Only about half of direct mailers are recycled. Ensuring there are no unexpected plastics, and that the postcard will be fully recyclable is a simple check, but important for ethical assurance. Using pre-recycled materials is another great way of supporting green initiatives. Plus, it can be a nice marketing plus, showing that your materials are made from recycled materials.

## TLDR: How to do it right?
- Get consent before sending
- Make sure what you are sending is valuable
- Be environmentally friendly
	* Buy carbon offsets (probably): [26g of carbon](http://inspiredeconomist.com/2009/03/09/greening-print-marketing-whats-your-mails-carbon-footprint/) per postcard
	* Use recyclable materials
