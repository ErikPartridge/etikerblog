## Preface
To determine if Facebook was right in sharing the user data to phone manufacturers, we need to first determine what a third party means. It sounds simple--anyone outside the company. In practice, this gets a lot trickier with the way modern software systems are developed.

## How we define third party


## A bit more context for this case
[The New York Times reported](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/06/03/technology/facebook-device-partners-users-friends-data.html) earlier this month that Facebook, despite having testified to Congress a month earlier, had shared user data with phone manufacturers, including the data that a user's friends had on the Facebook platform. To some, this may appear to be a violation of the 2011 F.T.C. agreement requiring user consent when sharing data with third parties. Facebook had agreed to this, in order to settle a complaint made regarding their data sharing practices in its earlier years. Facebook argues that phone manufacturers were instead service providers, and therefore exempt from requiring consent. Facebook's claims are under a substantial level of scrutiny.

Perhaps the most central thing to this specific instance, is the F.T.C.'s 2011 agreement. This revolved around a complaint that Facebook had failed to keep user data private and safe. To resolve this, Facebook agreed that they would receive consent from users before sharing data with a third party, and that should they violate this, the F.T.C. could fine them $40,000 per instance, per day. Facebook cannot claim ignorance either--it is clear from this that they were aware of the need to collect informed consent, and have been sternly warned before the F.T.C. before. This is not the first time Facebook has gotten itself in hot water like this before.

## The ethical principles
In this case, the most substantial principle in question is that of informed consent. In effect, this would be entirely fine if Facebook had given the users a box asking if they could share this data with the person's phone manufacturer and for what purposes. _Except maybe not._ Because Facebook was sharing data involving the users' friends, Facebook could not reasonably claim in any situation, to have obtained consent to share this data with phone manufacturers. This works on the same general principle and reasoning that a friend of yours cannot legally sign a contract in your name, in most situations, nor should they be able to.

## So, was Facebook right?
Mostly not, no. Very limited data sharing _could_ be ethically okay without having informed users beyond the Terms &amp; Conditions of their site. For example, if the Facebook app was crashing on Blackberry anytime a user got a notification of a friends birthday party, Facebook could reasonably share this data with Blackberry if they conclude it to be a hardware issue. Although, sharing the name and location of the friend's birthday party would not be. It's about sharing the minimal amount, in an anonymous fashion, for legitimate purposes to keep the services functioning. That's okay. Just sharing user and users' friends' data to the phone companies, is not.
