## Preface
To determine if Facebook was right in sharing the user data to phone manufacturers, we need to first determine what a third party means. It sounds simple--anyone outside the company. In practice, this gets a lot trickier with the way modern software systems are developed.

## How we define third party


## A bit more context for this case
[The New York Times reported](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/06/03/technology/facebook-device-partners-users-friends-data.html) earlir this month that Facebook, despite having testified to Congress a month earlier, had shared user data with phone manufacturers, including the data that a user's friends had on the Facebook platform. To some, this may appear to be a violation of the 2011 F.T.C. agree requiring user consent when sharing data with third parties that Facebook had agreed to, in order to settle a complaint made regarding their data sharing practices. Facebook argues that phone manufacturers were instead service providers, and therefore exempt from requiring consent. Facebook's claims are under a substantial level of scrutiny.

Perhaps the most central thing to this specific instance, is the F.T.C.'s 2011 agreement. This revolved around a complaint that Facebook had failed to keep user data private and safe. To resolve this, Facebook agreed that they would receive consent from users before sharing data with a third party, and that should they violate this, the F.T.C. could fine them $40,000 per instance, per day. Facebook cannot claim ignorance either--it is clear from this that they were aware of the need to collect informed consent, and have been sternly warned before the F.T.C. before. This is not the first time Facebook has gotten itself in hot water like this before.

## The ethical principles
In this case, the most substantial principle in question is that of informed consent. In effect, this would be entirely fine if Facebook had given the users a box asking if they could share this data with the person's phone manufacturer and for what purposes. _Except maybe not._ Because Facebook was sharing data involving the users' friends, it is probably not feasible in any situation for Facebook to ethically claim that they had obtained informed consent to share this data with phone manufacturers, for the same reason that a friend of yours can't legally sign a contract in your name, in most situations.

## So was Facebook right?
Mostly not, no.
