## Preface
To determine if Facebook was right in sharing the user data to phone manufacturers, we need to first determine what a third party means. It sounds simple--anyone outside the company. In practice, this gets a lot trickier with the way modern software systems are developed.

## How we define third party


## A bit more context for this case


## The ethical principles
In this case, the most substantial principle in question is that of informed consent. In effect, this would be entirely fine if Facebook had given the users a box asking if they could share this data with the person's phone manufacturer and for what purposes. _Except maybe not._ Because Facebook was sharing data involving the users' friends, it is probably not feasible in any situation for Facebook to ethically claim that they had obtained informed consent to share this data with phone manufacturers, for the same reason that a friend of yours can't legally sign a contract in your name, in most situations.

## So was Facebook right?
Mostly not, no.
