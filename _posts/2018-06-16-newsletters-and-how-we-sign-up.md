## Disclaimer
At times throughout this article, we will briefly discuss the approach various countries have taken to legislating newsletter sign-ups. We are not lawyers, this is not legal advice. If you are planning your own newsletter, please contact a lawyer to discuss applicable laws in your area.

## Common Practices
Various countries have set out various standards for newsletter consent, and there seem to be a few common practices across the industry. The two largest pieces of legislation in the field are the American CAN-SPAM Act, which requires users to be able to opt-out of mailing lists among other key details, and the European Union's GDPR which requires business to collect explicit consent from users before emailing.

#### 1) Sign-up modal or sign-up form
One common approach, especially for blogs is to show a pop-up dialogue box inviting the user to enter their email to be signed up for the mailing list. This approach is widely viewed as not a polite approach nor considerate, are generally poorly regarded. However, this does not inherently make them unethical. In fact, in our view, a sign-up modal can be perfectly ethical. If it explains that the user is signing up for a newsletter, and how this data will be shared if any, the business is on the right track. Taking this one step further, and ensuring the user can easily decline or cancel the modal, is all that is required to make the dialogue box approach ethical.

Some other sites do a modified version of this, where there is a banner or some other place for people emails to subscribe. So long as users are informed as to third party sharing (and if you have not read about [ethics and third party sharing](https://blog.etiker.com/blog/was-facebook-right/), now would be a great time), this is totally fine and ethical.

#### 2) Uncheck a box to opt-out
For sites that users must register for, a frequent approach is to require a user to uncheck a pre-checked box in order to not be subscribed to the newsletter. This is not an ethical practice, although it may result in more users on the newsletter. This violates the principle of informed consent; opting out is not an active consent in the same way that opting in is. 

Another approach to thinking about this is asking oneself, would more than five percent of my users feel as if they have been tricked into signing up. This is a nice way of tracking as well. A certain amount will also not be aware of how to opt-out, therefore, if metrics indicate that a business has more than one to two percent of recipients unsubscribing or reporting the email as spam on the first email they are sent, there is very likely an ethics problem present as well. 

In 2011, the European Union prohibited [auto-checked boxes for sales](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-15260748), and signing up for a newsletter should not be thought to be much different than a sale. The customer may not be paying with money for a newsletter, but they are paying with their personal information and a free opportunity to advertise. More recently, the GDPR regulations created by the European Union have made it requisite for explicit consent for newsletters. Most companies have taken this to mean a box must be explicitly checked.

#### 3) Check a box to opt-in
When users create an account, another approach is allowing users to decide to check a box to opt-in to the newsletter. This is a great, and perfectly ethical approach, presuming that users are informed as to what they are opting in to (this includes data sharing). This informed consent is perhaps the most ethical approach to apply. Users have their own discretion to make a decision to sign up. When it comes to users paying for something, or in a situation where they would otherwise have to provide their email, this approach is what we generally recommend for our clients at Etiker to gain newsletter sign ups as well.

#### 4) User must click a link in email to opt-out
In the United States, under the CAN-SPAM Act, generally user opt-in is not required, however users must be able to opt-out of the newsletter list at any time. However, emailing users whose consent has not been obtained is not an ethical practice, despite its possible legality.

This approach completely disregards the principle of informed consent, and only gives a user after the fact ability to manage their data. Even then, it is not retroactive, nor is it necessarily informed. The principle of opt-out simply does not work well with the principle of informed consent, and acting upon data collected in the first place without informed consent is an issue.

At the same time, having an opt-out link in mailing lists adhering to ethical principles regarding data collection is a good thing. It may be required under the CAN-SPAM Act, and allowing users to revoke their consent is key to maintaining informed consent over time. This is absolutely a practice that should be encouraged once users are signed up, albeit an unethical method to initial registration.

## Concluding Thoughts
Informed consent matters, even when it's just a newsletter, and laws across the world are becoming more strict on this in recent years. When it comes to gathering informed consent, having a nice box for users to enter their email and a short explanation of what they are signing up for can do wonders. Even a simple checkbox (unchecked!) and explanation when they register is another great way of collecting user emails. 

After all happy users buy more, and if they want to sign up they are almost certainly going to want to be a repeat customer. Trying to get a customer to sign-up against their desires is more likely to annoy the customer, and may actually reduce the chances that they come back for another sale.
